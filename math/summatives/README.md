Optimization Using Gradient Descent: Linear Regression


In this assignment, you will build a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses. You will investigate three different approaches to this problem: using NumPy and Scikit-Learn linear regression models, as well as constructing and optimizing the sum of squares cost function with gradient descent from scratch.
